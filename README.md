# FlaUIServer

Experimental implementation of Selenium like server using FlaUI. Inspired by [FlaUI.WebDriver](https://github.com/FlaUI/FlaUI.WebDriver).

Compatible API with [Appium Windows Driver](https://github.com/appium/appium-windows-driver), for seamless switching between WinAppDriver and FlaUI.

Not all endpoints implemented.
